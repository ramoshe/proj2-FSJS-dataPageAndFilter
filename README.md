## Project Description
*From Treehouse*
In this project, you'll use a common web development technique known as “pagination” to enhance the usability of a web page.

You'll start with a file that contains information for 42 students, including name, email, and picture. You'll start by using your JavaScript skills to display the first nine students on the page. Then you will add navigation, also known as pagination buttons, that the user can click to display different pages of students.

Your application will need to work with a list of any number of students, not just with the supplied array of 42 students. This means your solutions need to be flexible enough to handle arrays of student data of various lengths.

For this project, you will want to write your code using plain JavaScript, sometimes known as “vanilla” JavaScript. Avoid using jQuery or any other libraries, plugins, or code snippets for any aspect of this project, including the pagination.

After completing this project you'll have some powerful JavaScript skills and a strong second portfolio piece to show off to potential employers.
